A lot of the ideas I come up with are basically requested by Nick, I stress basically.I will talk to him about songs he and Dom are working on to get ideas for dioramas... What I get is more alone the lines of, I want to be fat in one with Don licking a lollipop. So I go from there.

Using my kids toys with my sketches of Nick & Dom as well as Bob the (Drummer). I came up with this scene.I do all the pyrotechnics myself, without the kids around. Safety First. I use a lot of LED lighting on the mini sets to control the atmosphere ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/436c425e-0680-4624-9504-227a2f4bb896.jpg)

Here for example ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d96c3ece-c314-4873-a957-810dfe5ba643.jpg)

How did all this shit start from?

I asked Nick what the music was about. He just said "Its about nothing really. I just get in a Car an listen to Dom's tracks an go from there." Nick said "I only have one rule. In this universe you are creating It's me an Dominic. All Dom's everywhere. All other characters are Dom... Dominic Constantine is the other half behind Nick & the Narcissists

At the time they really weren't playing out much at all. Nick was just focused on making music. So I wasn't getting a lot of photography to work from. So I decided to work my love of comics into Nick's music. Note to self was the first song I worked on.

I used a combination of sketches of nick and Dom with a comic book filter on my photography

Why the 72 Eldorado ?

It's an Easter egg form Nick old band (Stuffing) Its a lyric from the song : "Black round my eyes" circa 1996\. It developed into a 1959 Cadillac Coupe Deville in 2014 with this image. I then ordered a 1/18 Scale Model for photo reference. 

This is the first paper cut out of Nick.
