Using my kids toys with my sketches of Nick & Dom as well as Bob the (Drummer). I came up with this scene.I do all the pyrotechnics myself, without the kids around. Safety First. I use a lot of LED lighting on the mini sets to control the atmosphere ![](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f842b0715e02f669443edfd57cc043b3/passthrough.jpg?height=492&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb7168fcf467b456606a8f830790d1c77c0cece65.jpg&width=750)

I asked Nick what the music was about. He just said "Its about nothing really. I just get in a Car an listen to Dom's tracks an go from there." Nick said "I only have one rule. In this universe you are creating It's me an Dominic. All Dom's everywhere. All other characters are Dom... Dominic Constantine is the other half behind Nick & the Narcissists

At the time they really weren't playing out much at all. Nick was just focused on making music. So I wasn't getting a lot of photography to work from. So I decided to work my love of comics into Nick's music. Note to self was the first song I worked on.

It's an Easter egg form Nick old band (Stuffing) Its a lyric from the song : "Black round my eyes" circa 1996\. It developed into a 1959 Cadillac Coupe Deville in 2014 with this image. I then ordered a 1/18 Scale Model for photo reference. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7f921593-5903-46f6-88c8-400733874d15.jpg)
